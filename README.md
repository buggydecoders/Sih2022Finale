Aspirant Institutes can simply search for the required resource and our recommendation system ensures that they find the most suitable resource as quickly as possible based on several factors like location, budget, etc. Once the institute finds the required resource they can either put a request for that or they can connect with the lending institute via chat or video call to know more about the resource. The lending institutes receive requests from many other institutes, so to optimize resource utilization we have implemented a scheduling algorithm that ensures that maximum institutes get access to the resource in a particular duration of time. The lending institute picks one of the filtered institutes and sends them an agreement. We have implemented blockchain based smart agreements to ensure fair use of the shared resource. And once the sharing duration of a resource ends, both institutes have to give each other some feedback and we run a sentimental analysis on that feedback and assign both institutes some internal points which will affect their future chances of getting any resource.

 We have tried to cover every edge case and built an user friendly UI which allows new users to use our portal with minimal learning curve.
